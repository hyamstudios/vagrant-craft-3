# Vagrant Craft 3

Starter Craft CMS 3 setup using Vagrant for local development. This setup uses a special port number to allow testing the site without modifying a hosts file. The site should be accessible to other devices on the same network.

Initial site url is http://localhost:8378. Or using the local computer name like [http://COMPUTER_NAME:8378](http://COMPUTER_NAME:8378). Port number is adjustable modified in the Vagrantfile.

Vagrant settings support macOS and Windows. Virtual machine is running Ubuntu 16 with PHP 7.0.

Installation includes Xdebug for PHP debugging and Visual Studio Code launch.json.

This tool also helps you setup a Digital Ocean droplet with the same Vagrant setup. Since the only I want from this tool is to setup a hosted CraftCMS instance for headless usage. Nothing will be synced between the local and remote setup. In other words, `vagrant up local` is not required to run `vagrant up digitalocean`.

Some plugins for CraftCMS are installed during the bootstrap. If you don't see them enabled in the CraftCMS dashboard, please go to settings -> plugins and click "install" for each of them again.

## Requirements

- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
- [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/)

For deployment to Digital Ocean, you'll need

- [Vagrant DigitalOcean Plugin](https://github.com/devopsgroup-io/vagrant-digitalocean)
- [Vagrant Secret Plugin](https://github.com/tcnksm/vagrant-secret)

## Instructions

1. Clone/download repository
1. Run `vagrant secret-init`
1. Use `vagrant-secret-example.yaml` as an example to fill in the Vagrant secret file: `./vagrant/secret.yaml`

## Deploy A Droplet

1. Make sure you already have the Digital Ocean API Token at hand, as well as your SSH key was already added to DO's dashboard.
1. Run `vagrant up digitalocean`, a droplet will be created and configured.
1. When it is done, copy the droplet IP and configure your domain to point to it.
1. If HTTPS does not work, run `vagrant provision digitalocean`, it will run LetsEncrypt process again.
1. Go to `https://YOUR_DOMAIN/admin/install` to finish CraftCMS setup.
1. Don't forget to rename the droplet in Digital Ocean!

After the above procedure, Vagrant will remember which droplet it provisioned by recording the droplet's id in `.vagrant/machines/digitalocean`.

If you want to create another droplet with the Vagrant setup, simply rename or delete the `.vagrant` folder and start over again.

### Tips

- `vagrant destroy digitalocean` will actually destroy(a.k.a. delete) the droplet in Digital Ocean. Be careful!
- To improve the provisioning process, please setup a testing droplet with `vagrant up digitalocean`, and use `vagrant provision digitalocean` to re-run everything apart from the machine setup. Most of the things in `bootstrap-server.sh` will be applied again.

## Local Setup

1. Run `vagrant up local` and wait for installation
1. Go to http://localhost:8378/admin/install to finalize Craft installation
   1. Fill in fields â€“ password as `password`, database as `craft`
   1. Create first admin account
   1. Enter site details, leaving Base URL = **@web**
